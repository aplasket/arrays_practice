**1. How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?**  I am understanding arrays ok but I am unsure how to run this code in the terminal to test that it works. Also I missed that I was supposed to create a github repository in step 1 so (THANKFULLY) I was still able to do so and add it in at the end (WHEW) and all commits still tracked! 

**2. Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?**

yes, to my above questions:
- how do I run this code in the terminal to ensure that all the array methods are calling correctly? We're creating all the code in a ruby file in VS Code. So how do we then run it in the terminal? do i need to quickly run irb or replit to check it?

- whats the difference between intiializing git (`git init`) and  initializing a git repository (creating a git repo and adding `git remote add origin SSH`)?

**3. What questions do you have about Arrays?**
Can you help give us an example of when we would use an array for booleans? that one seems so specific to other variables that I'm curious what an example would be of having an array of booleans be useful.
